# Reddit Client

A simple reddit client to browse top posts, done with a modern React stack using hooks for data fetching, routing and redux integration.

Includes CLI Scaffolding for creating components, routes or state slices.

This was bootstrapped with my [hooked-stack](https://github.com/brunomolteni/hooked-stack) project.

## Running the app

First install dependencies

```
npm i
```

To run development server

```
npm start
```

To build for production

```
npm run build
```

To scaffold new components, routes or redux slices. You'll get an interactive prompt to define what you want.

```
npm run new
```

If you already know what you want to create you can make it faster passing the arguments, for example:

```
npm run new component someComponent
```
